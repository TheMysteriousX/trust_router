Eventually this document may go away or hold README information for
the trust router.  Right now, it serves as a to-do list for work that
needs to be done on the trust router code before various releases:

TO-DO FOR BETA
==============
DONE - Eliminate bulk of info/debug messages
DONE - Java encode/decode of full requests/responses
DONE - Generate a real random number for DH code (in common/tr_dh.c)
DONE - DH server-side code (in TIDS)
IN PROGRESS - Read TR router config from file at start-up (non-dynamic)
- Tree/look-up code to find correct AAA Server for a COI/Realm in TR
- Code for client to handle multiple oustanding requests
IN PROGRESS - TIDC and TIDS integration with freeradius

TO-DO FOR PILOT
===============
- Dynamically re-read TR configuration file at runtime
- Move to longer-term tasking model for TR
- Normalize/configure logging for info msgs, warnings and errors (log4c?)
- Clean-up gsscon API

TO-DO FOR PRODUCTION
====================
- Multiple Trust Router support including TR protocol
- Consider standard encoding of DH info (from ?? WG)
