Eventually this document may go away or hold README information for
the trust router.  Right now, it serves as a to-do list for work that
needs to be done on the trust router code before various releases:

TO-DO FOR BETA RELEASE (originally due Jan 2013)
======================
DONE - GSS connection API (based on MIT example code)
DONE - DH implementation and test code (based on openssl)
DONE - TID server and client implementation (API & example code)
DONE - Add DH server-side code to TIDS
DONE - JSON encode/decode of TID requests/responses (jansson)
DONE - Eliminate bulk of info/debug messages (mostly from GSS code)
DONE - Generate a real random number for DH (in common/tr_dh.c)
DONE - Read TR portal/manual config from files at start-up (non-dynamic)
DONE - Look-up code to find correct AAA Server for a Comm/Realm
IN PROGRESS - TR TID request & response handlers
IN PROGRESS - TIDS integration with freeradius server (Sam)
IN PROGRESS - TIDC integration with freeradius proxy (incl default comm config)
- Handle community configuration in AAA proxy (per-request config)
- Map a COI to an APC in TR (incl config & lookup code)
- Check rp_realm COI membership in TR 
- Check idp_realm APC membership in TR 
- Check gss_name in TR
- Resolve TBDs for error handling and memory deallocation

TO-DO FOR FULL PILOT VERSION (~2 months after beta release)
============================
- Move to better tasking model for TR (needed for dyn cfg and TR protocol)
- Dynamically re-read TR configuration file at runtime
- Keep single connection open between AAA proxy & TR for TID requests
- Normalize/configure logging for info msgs, warnings and errors (log4c)
- Clean-up gsscon API and messages
- Handle IPv6 addresses in TID req/resp (use getaddrinfo())
- Implement rp_permitted filters (incl. general filtering mechanism)
- Add constraints to TID req in TR, store and use them in AAA Server
- Use valgrind to check for memory leaks, other issues
- Full functional testing

TO-DO FOR PRODUCTION VERSION (August 2013)
============================
- Multiple Trust Router support including implementation of TR protocol
- Consider standard encoding of DH info (from jose WG)
- Algorithm agility in TID protocol?
