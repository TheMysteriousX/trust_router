Eventually this document may go away or hold README information for
the trust router.  Right now, it serves as a to-do list for work that
needs to be done on the trust router code before various releases:

- Read TR router configuration from a file at start-up
- Tree/look-up code to find correct AAA Server for a COI/Realm in TR
- TPQC and TIDRS integration with freeradius

- Dynamically re-read TR configuration file at runtime
- Move to longer-term tasking model for TR
