Eventually this document may go away or hold README information for
the trust router.  Right now, it serves as a to-do list for work that
needs to be done on the trust router code before various releases:

TO-DO FOR TPQ/TIDR DEMO
=======================
- DH server-side code (in TIDRS)
- Eliminate bulk of info/debug messages
- Hardwire AAA Server choice in TR
- Java encode/decode of full requests/responses

TO-DO FOR BETA
==============
- Generate a real random number for DH code (in common/tr_dh.c)
- Read TR router configuration from a file at start-up (non-dynamic)
- Tree/look-up code to find correct AAA Server for a COI/Realm in TR
- TPQC and TIDRS integration with freeradius
- Code for client to handle multiple oustanding requests
- Finish info/debug msg clean-up, all errors to stderr

TO-DO FOR PORTAL BETA
=====================
- Dynamically re-read TR configuration file at runtime
- Move to longer-term tasking model for TR

TO-DO FOR PILOT
===============
- Trust Router protocol implementation
- Normalize/configure logging for info msgs, warnings and errors
